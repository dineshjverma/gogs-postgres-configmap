# gogs-postgres-configmap

This Git repository serves as a comprehensive guide and reference for deploying a multi-tier application using Gogs and Postgres in Kubernetes, utilizing the power of ConfigMaps. 

ConfigMaps are a fundamental Kubernetes feature that allows you to decouple application configurations from the container images, enabling greater flexibility and ease of management. By leveraging ConfigMaps, this repository showcases an efficient and scalable deployment strategy for a multi-tier application.

The primary components of this deployment include Gogs, a self-hosted Git service, and Postgres, a powerful open-source relational database management system. Together, they form a resilient and scalable architecture for hosting and managing Git repositories while persisting the data securely in Postgres.

The repository contains a set of configuration files, scripts, and manifests that provide a step-by-step guide for deploying the application stack in a Kubernetes cluster. It includes YAML files for creating the necessary deployments, services, and ConfigMaps to establish the Gogs and Postgres infrastructure.

With detailed documentation and well-structured code, this repository enables users to understand the intricacies of deploying a multi-tier application using Gogs and Postgres in a Kubernetes environment. It covers key aspects such as containerization, networking, service discovery, and data persistence.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced Kubernetes user, this repository offers valuable insights into the best practices for managing a multi-tier application deployment. By following the provided instructions, you can quickly spin up your own Git service powered by Gogs and leverage the robustness of Postgres as the underlying database.

Explore this repository to gain hands-on experience in deploying and managing multi-tier applications in Kubernetes, leveraging the power of ConfigMaps, and integrating popular tools like Gogs and Postgres. Empower your development workflow with a resilient and scalable infrastructure that enables efficient collaboration and data persistence.
